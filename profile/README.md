# Elevated Sensors

**Elevated Sensors** is building the smart home tech we wish existed. Reliable, local-first, and yours to control.
Our hardware works without internet, accounts, or vendor lock-in. We design with open tools like ESPHome, LibrePCB,
and FreeCAD, and we [give back](https://opencollective.com/elevated_sensors) to the open source community every month.

**Reliable. Local. Hackable. Yours.**
